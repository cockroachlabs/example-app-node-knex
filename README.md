This repo contains a simple Node.js CRUD app that uses [Knex.js](https://knexjs.org/) and the [node-postgres](https://node-postgres.com/) driver to talk to a CockroachDB cluster.

For instructions on running the code in this repo, see [Build a Simple CRUD Node.js App with CockroachDB and Knex.js](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/build-a-nodejs-app-with-cockroachdb-knexjs.html).
